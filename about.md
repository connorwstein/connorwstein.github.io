I am software developer interested primarily in distributed systems and blockchains. I spent a few years working on networking projects at Cisco Systems including a network controller for large-scale data centers and the IS-IS routing protocol. Before that I studied electrical engineering at McGill. Outside of software, I am interested in music, spanish, cognition, philosophy, mathematics and economics.
