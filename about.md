Welcome internet explorer! I am a software developer mostly interested in distributed systems and blockchains, but I also like [cryptography](https://github.com/connorwstein/cryptopals), [good books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28187620-connor-stein), [economics](https://github.com/connorwstein/exchange), dancing in my kitchen and exploring NYC. I use this blog as a learning tool, but hopefully those with similar interests will find some posts useful. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:connor.stein2@gmail.com) if you have any questions or want to chat.
