title: RC comes to an end
---

###### What actually happened part 2
Sept 23 - Oct 15
- A lot of interviews - interviewed with 7 companies out of the 12 I applied to, reaching various stages of their processes. Some of the take home assignments took up a lot of time but were fun. Along with doing these came still more of the leetcode/algorithm design manual stuff. 

Sept 23 - Nov 5
- I worked on an Ethereum dapp ([decentralized hackerrank](https://github.com/connorwstein/decentralized_hackerrank)) and read some more of the [mastering ethereum book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook) and [effective go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

Sept 26 - Oct 11
- I worked through the first 2 chapters of SICP, this was a lot more time consuming than I thought but also really valuable and has definitely changed the way I think about programming.

General
- Held a number of crypto study group sessions where we went over IPFS, Ouroboros, Plasma and zkSnarks.

###### Random memorable experiences
- That time an impromptu 2-hour Group theory lesson broke out in the afternoon with Rai and Aaron
- The halloween party where Max B showed off his free liner project, a tool for building dynamic light show patterns
- Playing the chess-like game which had upgradeable pieces that Natalie made on her launchpad 
- Attended a wide variety of awesome talks: Olga on weaving technology, Kat’s Streaming Into the Void project, Gretchen on bioinformatics, Aaron W on hamming codes, Kao's attempt at an original proof of the James-Stein estimator, Aaron S on algorithm shading, Chris on CRDTs, Felix’s type theory project “type zoo”,  Josh’s PANE project, Charlie’s PICO8 stuff and the list goes on...

###### Thoughts
- I think its interesting how near the end of it I sort of craved external deadlines, tests or otherwise concrete measures of completion. I also started retreating to more structured learning like university course materials. Its probably easier to learn/work on projects in a "free-style” manner if you are already sort of specialized and you really understand the tools and the design space you are working in. The fact that I was really exploring the technical developments in the blockchain space for the first time meant that the most value for me was more like introductory/university class like materials.
- I definitely did notice that when I had a deadline like an on-site interview or a Thursday presentation how a mass increase in productivity was spurred.   I think prior to coming to RC I underestimated the value of an external deadline. One piece of advice for future RCers is to totally sign up for the presentations as a way to set a deadline for yourself!
- Definitely came out of RC inspired by peoples patience when learning new material. There were quite a few folks who I was impressed with how they picked a topic, fully committed to it, then steadily worked through the problems in a textbook slowly building a way deeper understanding than you normally get by stackoverflowing/googling as part of a normal software job.
