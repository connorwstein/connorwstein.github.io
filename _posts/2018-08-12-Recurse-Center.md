I am about to start a session at the Recurse Center in NYC! My list of things to learn and do has vastly outpaced what I was able to accomplish in nights and weekends with a full time job and I was looking for a place to focus on exploring computer science in the absence of Outlook and meetings. Grad schools operate on very strict and very long application cycles and the Recurse Center seemed to fit in perfectly. In addition to fundamental computer science topics, I plan to take a look a closer look the technical developments in the blockchain space as well.

Fundamentals:
- [Work through SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html#%25_toc_start)
- [MIT distributed systems labs in golang](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)
- [Do a bunch of DS&A challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [Cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)
- [Game theory coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1)

Blockchain
- [Go on a paper implementing and reading spree](https://github.com/decrypto-org/blockchain-papers)
- [The mastering ethereum book](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)

Projects
- A basic blockchain
- A merkle tree which syncs state to a hot-standby for node failover
- Add a zero-knowledge security layer to the blockchain using [zkSnarks](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks.html)
- Try to apply some game theory concepts to the blockchain
- Maybe some other crazy stuff like auto generating a smart contract from a body of text

Pretty amazing that all these resources are free and readily available - the internet really is magnificent. It is extremely unlikely I will get through all of that in three months, but its probably better to have a list that is too long rather than too short. 

Some stuff that didnâ€™t make the cut:
- Emulate a goroutine in C
- Go package which provides a memory allocated
- Psuedowire support in docker - point-to-point connections between containers
- Chrome plugin to quantify your reading habits (topic focus, word counts, etc.)
- Blockchain for distributed consensus on shared document edits
- Code up some evolutionary algorithms and let them interact in a network of containers
- Automatic code refactorer
- Research feed pulling from arxiv, conferences, tech meetups 
- Implement TCP
- Tool which allows you to tweak the state of a router in a network and gives you visual feedback on the state changes and new states of other nodes
- Extract transition probabilities between words from a body of english text
- Torrent network with docker containers
- Implement a basic OS in a purely functional language 
- Implement the keberos protocol
- Do a kaggle competition
- Replicate results in some ML papers
